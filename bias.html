<p><strong>See how many biases occur in the following example of a selection interview scenario. Hover over the text to find the answers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider how these biases might shape your assessment of the candidate.</strong></p>

<p>A candidate enters the room and your colleague leans in and quietly remarks, 
  <span class="bias" data-bias="Stereotyping, Priming">"This is the one from that overconfident Gen Z group I mentioned."</span> 
  Although the candidate greets you politely and shakes hands confidently, the comment seems to echo in your head; as they begin speaking, 
  <span class="bias" data-bias="Confirmation bias">you start listening for signs of arrogance in their responses</span>.
</p>

<p>A few minutes in, the candidate falters slightly when asked about a situation involving customer interaction. 
  <span class="bias" data-bias="Horns effect">That brief stumble colours your overall impression</span>, making the earlier confidence seem rehearsed.
</p>

<p>Later, they hesitate while trying to recall details from a recent group project. 
  <span class="bias" data-bias="Fundamental attribution error">You assume this reflects a lack of preparation rather than a case of nerves</span>.
</p>

<p>Near the end, they respond thoughtfully to a complex question about conflict management, outlining a well-reasoned approach. 
  <span class="bias" data-bias="Recency bias">This strong final response stands out in your memory</span>. When they mention their interest in hiking, 
  <span class="bias" data-bias="Like-me bias">you feel an unexpected sense of rapport because you also enjoy weekend trail walks</span>.
